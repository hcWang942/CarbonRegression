# Feature Importance Comparison Across Regression Methods

This analysis compares the feature importance (coefficients) from three regression methods:
- Linear Regression (standard OLS)
- LASSO Regression (L1 regularization)
- Ridge Regression (L2 regularization)

## Key Findings

- Most important feature in Linear Regression: SOxEmission
- Most important feature in LASSO Regression: SOxEmission
- Most important feature in Ridge Regression: SOxEmission

- LASSO eliminated the following features: TotalWater Use

## Coefficient Consistency

- TotalWater Use: Sign inconsistency across methods, suggesting instability
- ROE: Consistently negative effect across all methods
- TL: Consistently positive effect across all methods
- PPE: Consistently positive effect across all methods
- SOxEmission: Consistently positive effect across all methods
